Below is an updated README that replaces the React web client with a **Next.js** web application, while retaining React Native (if you still plan on building a mobile app). Feel free to customize further based on your exact setup and deployment preferences.

## Introduction
SalonAI is an AI-powered scheduling and recommendation platform designed to streamline hair salon operations. It automates booking, scheduling, and quoting processes, and it provides personalized hairstyle and color recommendations for clients. By integrating Next.js on the front end, the system supports better SEO and server-side rendering where needed.

## Features
1. **AI-Based Recommendations**  
   - Suggests personalized hairstyles and color options using an LLaMA model fine-tuned on client history.  
   - Logs recommendations for stylist review and future reference.

2. **Automated Scheduling & Booking**  
   - Allows clients to view availability, book appointments, and receive instant confirmations.  
   - Minimizes double bookings or scheduling conflicts.

3. **Salon Management Tools**  
   - Provides salon staff with a unified dashboard for appointments, staff schedules, and real-time updates.  
   - Handles quoting and pricing logic, role-based access, and analytics (optional).

4. **Multi-Platform Access**  
   - **Next.js (Web)**: Enables server-side rendering (SSR) for pages that require SEO, or static site generation (SSG) for more performance.  
   - **React Native (Mobile)**: (Optional) for iOS and Android apps with booking, notifications, and on-the-go operations.

---

## System Architecture
The application is designed in layered components for scalability and maintainability:  
citeturn0file0

1. **Presentation Layer (Front-End)**
   - **Next.js (Web)**: Leverages server-side rendering and/or static generation for SEO-friendly, fast-loading pages.
   - **React Native (Mobile)**: (Optional) for native mobile applications.

2. **Application Layer (Backend)**
   - **Django (REST Framework)** or **Flask + SQLAlchemy** (choose based on preference).  
   - Exposes REST endpoints for booking, user management, and style recommendation requests.

3. **AI Module**
   - **LLaMA model (7B or 13B)**, typically hosted on a local GPU server (e.g., 2×NVIDIA V100).  
   - Provides recommendation logic via internal REST or gRPC calls.  
   - Uses techniques like LoRA or QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

4. **Data Layer (Database)**
   - **PostgreSQL** (recommended) or MySQL for persistent data (appointments, user profiles, stylists, etc.).  
   - Optional **Redis cache** for quick data retrieval or repeated AI queries.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3, Django (or Flask), Django REST Framework (or equivalent)  
- **Front-End**: Next.js (Node.js, TypeScript/JavaScript)  
- **Mobile (Optional)**: React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (preferred) or MySQL  
- **AI**: LLaMA 7B or 13B model with GPU support  
- **Containerization/Orchestration**: Docker, docker-compose, optionally Kubernetes  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub / GitLab for branching and pull requests  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and builds

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SalonAI.git
cd SalonAI
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file (or similar) to store database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive info:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/salonai
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000   # or wherever your backend is hosted
```

### 3. Backend Setup
- **Install Python dependencies**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Run Migrations** (Django example):
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
- **Start Server**:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
By default, the Django server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 4. AI Module Setup
- Ensure you have a GPU environment with the necessary CUDA drivers.
- Place your LLaMA model weights in the specified directory (e.g., `ai_module/weights/`).
- Install any required libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate, BitsandBytes, etc.).
- Start the AI service (this may be a separate Flask/FastAPI or gRPC service):
  ```bash
  python ai_module/service.py
  ```
Adjust accordingly if your AI module is integrated directly into Django/Flask.

### 5. Front-End Setup (Next.js)
Inside the `frontend` (or `web`) directory (where the Next.js app is located):
1. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default, Next.js runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.

> **Note**: Configure your Next.js app to point to the Django/Flask endpoints (e.g., using an `API_URL` environment variable).

### 6. (Optional) Mobile Setup (React Native)
If you plan to build the mobile app:
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run on Android or iOS**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   # or
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```
Make sure you set the mobile app’s base URL to match the REST API location.

### 7. Docker / docker-compose (Optional)
A simple `docker-compose.yml` might define containers for:
- `web` (Django/Flask),
- `ai_module` (separate container with the LLaMA model),
- `db` (PostgreSQL),
- `frontend` (Next.js).

Bring everything up with:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Adjust ports and environment variables as needed.

## Usage
1. **Client Workflow**  
   - Sign up or log in via the Next.js website (or optional mobile app).  
   - Browse available staff times and book an appointment.  
   - View AI-generated hairstyle or color recommendations, along with price quotes.

2. **Salon Staff / Admin Workflow**  
   - Access a centralized scheduling dashboard showing all appointments.  
   - Confirm or override AI suggestions for styles or color plans.  
   - Update service pricing, manage staff schedules, and run performance analytics.

3. **Notifications & Updates**  
   - Clients receive email or push notifications (if on mobile) when appointments are confirmed or changed.  
   - Staff can see real-time updates and new booking requests on their Next.js admin console or mobile app.

---

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Write Python tests for each Django/Flask module (in a `tests/` folder or within each app).  
   - For Next.js, use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to test pages and components.
2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Evaluate end-to-end flows (booking, quoting, AI recommendations).
3. **Performance Tests**  
   - Check AI response times and concurrency for recommendations.  
   - Use [Locust](https://locust.io/) or JMeter if needed.
4. **User Acceptance Tests (UAT)**  
   - Simulate real-user scenarios with staging/demo data to validate the overall experience.
